# ldvisualization

I worked on a team (Hai Tuan Son Nguyen, Truc Linh  Mai, Hatem Fayed, Ahmed Boulila). My team Visgate worked based on the approach of agile project management, concepts and prototypes were developed, and then a Javascript application was developed using the Javascript library React.

# How to start?
- Clone the project
- Open with your IDE
- Go inside the "chart" folder
- Then write : npm start
- Done

# What's inside the project?
As a result, the data visualization are presented on two levels. On the top level, the user sees an overview of the learning progress across all 10 chapters and 3 additional modules. The next level shows the performance data from each section of the selected chapters. Ultimately, the daily processing of the user's tasks is recorded and visualized with a graphic view.
